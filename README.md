# Design-of-a-CMOS-Low-Power-Dynamic-Comparator-
Every A–D converter uses one or more analog comparators. An analog, or magnitude, comparator is a device which has two analog inputs, like an operational amplifier, and one output which is assumed to have only two states, generally compatible with the input of one of the logic circuit families. The output is in the ‘high’ (positive) state when the non-inverting input is more positive than the inverting one. It is in the ‘low’ state when the inverting input is more positive than the non-inverting one. It is assumed that the two inputs are never exactly the same.
